Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. The code includes necessary header files such as `<iostream>`, `<stdlib.h>`, `<conio.h>`, and `<string.h>`, which are used for input/output operations, standard library functions, console functions, and string handling, respectively.

2. The `casino_game` class is defined, which encapsulates the functionalities of the casino game.

3. The `disp()` method displays the initial welcome message and prompts the user to press any key to continue. After a key press, the screen is cleared.

4. The `inst()` method displays the instructions of the game, explaining the rules and how to play. After a key press, the screen is cleared.

5. The `main_menu()` method presents the main menu options to the player: start, help, and quit. The player's choice is stored in the variable `n`. Depending on the choice, different actions are performed. If the player selects start (1), the `start()` method is called. If the player selects help (2), the `inst()` method is called. If the player selects quit (3), the program exits.

6. The `start()` method initializes variables such as `ch` (used for user input), `name` (player's name), `guess` (player's guessed number), `randnum` (randomly generated winning number), `run` (a flag to control the game loop), and `bal` (player's balance, initially set to 10,000).

7. The player is prompted to enter their name. The game loop begins with `run` set to 0.

8. Inside the game loop, the player's balance is displayed. The player is then prompted to enter their guess and the betting amount. If the betting amount exceeds the player's balance, an insufficient balance message is displayed, and the player is prompted to enter a valid betting amount.

9. If the player's guess does not match the randomly generated winning number, they lose the bet. They are prompted to try again or quit. If the player chooses to quit, the game loop ends, and a thank-you message is displayed along with the remaining balance. If the player chooses to try again, the screen is cleared.

10. If the player's guess matches the winning number, they win the bet, and the winning amount (10 times the bet) is added to their balance.

11. The game continues until the player chooses to quit.

12. In the `main()` function, an instance of the `casino_game` class is created, and its methods (`disp()`, `inst()`, `main_menu()`) are called in sequence to simulate the flow of the casino game.
